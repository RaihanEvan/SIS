StudentDAO Class:
The StudentDAO class is responsible for handling database operations related to the Student entity.
It provides methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the student table in the database.
The class establishes a database connection using JDBC and executes SQL queries to interact with the database.
Methods in the StudentDAO class:
getConnection(): Establishes a database connection using the JDBC driver and returns a Connection object.
getStudentList(): Retrieves a list of all students from the database and returns it as an ObservableList<Student>.
insertStudent(Student student): Inserts a new student record into the database using the provided Student object. It returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the insertion.
updateStudent(Student student): Updates an existing student record in the database with the data from the provided Student object. It returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the update.
deleteStudent(int studentId): Deletes a student record from the database based on the provided student ID. It returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the deletion.
checkStudentExists(int studentId): Checks if a student with the given ID already exists in the database. It returns true if the student exists, and false otherwise.
SceneFXMLController Class:
The SceneFXMLController class serves as the controller for the FXML file that defines the GUI of the application.
It handles the user interactions and performs necessary actions based on those interactions, such as inserting, updating, or deleting student records.
The class utilizes the StudentDAO class to interact with the database and retrieve or modify student data.
Methods in the SceneFXMLController class:
handleButtonAction(ActionEvent event): Handles button clicks in the GUI. It checks the source of the event and performs the corresponding action, such as inserting, updating, or deleting a student record.
initialize(URL url, ResourceBundle rb): Initializes the controller and sets up the initial state of the GUI. It calls the showStudent() method to populate the TableView with student data.
showStudent(): Retrieves the student data from the database using the StudentDAO class and displays it in the TableView.
insertRecord(): Retrieves the data from the input fields in the GUI, creates a new Student object, and inserts it into the database using the StudentDAO class.
updateRecord(): Retrieves the data from the input fields in the GUI, creates a new Student object, and updates the corresponding student record in the database using the StudentDAO class.
deleteRecord(): Retrieves the student ID from the input field in the GUI and deletes the corresponding student record from the database using the StudentDAO class.
executeQuery(String query): Executes the provided SQL query on the database using the StudentDAO class.
handleMouseAction(MouseEvent event): Handles mouse clicks on the TableView rows. It retrieves the selected student's data and populates the input fields in the GUI for editing or deletion.
These classes work together to provide a graphical user interface for managing student data and interact with the underlying database. The StudentDAO class handles the database operations, while the SceneFXMLController class manages the GUI and user interactions.
