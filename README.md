#STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

This is a Basic Java Desktop Application Project using JavaFX.

This Student Information System has an interface where there are a form and a table which is created with scenebuilder to appropriately place into a screen after the application launches. The form has some fields for student information. User can Insert,Update and Delete each student record accordingly. Simultaneously, the user can also see the corresponding table of students beside the form menu. Each student record is accessible by just clicking on the field and has instantly update or deleting flexibility. Basically its a CRUD application built with a basic knowledge of JavaFX.

I tried to apply the Object Oriented Paradigms as much as possible alongwith SOLID principles.
